# SimpleCosmos  
   
SimpleCosmos is a .NET 8 console application that demonstrates how to use Azure Cosmos DB with Entity Framework Core. The application allows users to create blogs with posts and associated cars through a terminal interface.  
   
## Features  
   
- Create multiple blogs with posts and cars through a terminal interface.  
- Store data in Azure Cosmos DB using Entity Framework Core.  
- Use dependency injection and configuration management.  
   
## Prerequisites  
   
- .NET 8 SDK  
- Azure Cosmos DB account  
   
## Getting Started  
   
### Clone the Repository  
   
```sh  
git clone https://github.com/hritthik-Insight/ConsoleCosmosBlog.git  
```  
   
### Configuration  
   
Create an `appsettings.json` file in the project root with the following content:  
   
```json  
{  
  "cosmosdb": {  
    "endpoint": "https://your-cosmos-db-account.documents.azure.com:443/",  
    "key": "your-cosmos-db-key",  
    "database": "db-name"  
  }  
}  
```  
   
Update the `endpoint`, `key`, and `database` values with your Azure Cosmos DB account details.  
   
### Build and Run  
   
```sh  
dotnet build  
dotnet run  
```  
   
## Usage  
   
When you run the application, you will be prompted to enter details for creating blogs, posts, and cars. The application will loop until you type `exit` to quit.  
   
### Example Interaction  
   
```plaintext  
Enter blog name (or type 'exit' to quit): My Blog  
Enter blog description: My Car blog  
Enter post title: My First Post  
Enter car name (or type 'done' to finish adding cars): Car 1  
Enter car name (or type 'done' to finish adding cars): Car 2  
Enter car name (or type 'done' to finish adding cars): done  
   
Blog added successfully!  
```
